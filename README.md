                        Console Baseclass Python

What is it?
-----------

The Console baseclass is a derivable python class that implements 
two main features:
* Process the terminal line input for flags customly defined. Each flag may require a type input
  and a default/custom method executed when the flag is present on the terminal. This functionality
  closely resembles the argparse module.
* A in-program console defining your own commands, with the same functionality
  of the flag parsing options mentioned above. This functionality closely resembles the cmd module, 
  but adds the functionality of flags, displaying their options. All terminal flag options and
  additional args are always present in both command and flag handler method (that is customly
  spesified).
